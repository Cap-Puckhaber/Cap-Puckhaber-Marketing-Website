## What is a Landing Page?
A landing page is a standalone web page created for a specific marketing campaign or goal. It's where visitors "land" after clicking on an ad, email, or search result. 

## Best Practices for Landing Page Design
- **Clear and Concise Headline:** Your headline should immediately tell visitors what the page is about and what action they should take.
- **Strong Call-to-Action (CTA):** The CTA should stand out and clearly explain what the user should do next.
